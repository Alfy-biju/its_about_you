### Project Description
wesbite that analyse your face and pulls out a sarcastic comment
### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People smile too much when they look in the mirror. We're fixing that with sarcasm.
### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We took a perfectly good webcam, taught it to recognize faces, and then made it mean. Using modern web tech, your face is lovingly scanned only to be served a random, well-timed sarcastic comment ‚Äî because compliments are overrated.

No real data, no actual analysis ‚Äî just a facial scan followed by a digital roast that leaves you wondering why you ever opened the site in the first place.

You're welcome. üôÉ

## Technical Details
HTML lays the foundation ‚Äî like a red carpet for your face to enter.

CSS adds the sparkle, sass, and style ‚Äî because ugly apps can't throw shade.

JavaScript does the real magic:

Accesses your webcam (with consent ‚Äî we‚Äôre sarcastic, not creepy).

When a face is detected, JavaScript randomly selects a sarcastic comment from a pre-written list of zingers.

The comment is then slapped on the screen 
### Technologies/Components Used
